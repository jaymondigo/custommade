	<p>Hey what's up!</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	I found that Buy Real Marketing brought the zooty up in my social media profiles and I've been using their services as part of my web strategies to, ya know, get famous and gain sweet worldwide domination. And just between us? It's damn wicked cool - so you might wanna try it!

	<p>Sign up at their {{HTML::link('/', 'Client Portal')}} and get 10% off the regular prices on their homepage.</p>
	<p>Now, I'm not supposed to let the cat out on that this early but, hey, we're cool so... </p>
	<br>
	<p>Cheers!</p>
